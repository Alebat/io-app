If you want to access the app faster without having to enter the PIN every time, you can do so by enabling biometric recognition via fingerprint directly from the settings of your operating system.

In the profile section of the IO app you can at any time decide whether to keep or disable biometric recognition ... try it, and you'll see that you won't want to do without it!
