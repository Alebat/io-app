To access the IO app you will need to authenticate with your SPID identity (Public Digital Identity System) or by using the CIE (Electronic Identity Card).
**Thanks to these registration systems your access to the app will always be secure.**  
To request a digital identity SPID you can visit [spid-gov.it] (https://www.spid.gov.it) and choose an Identity Provider from those proposed.
If you are interested in applying for the CIE, you can consult more information on your Municipality's website and book an appointment.
