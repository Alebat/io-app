**Here you can view all your saved payment methods, delete them or add new ones.** 
The payment methods used and saved previously to make payments with PagoPa, the Public Administration payment platform, are already saved even within the IO app.
IO currently only supports credit / debit card payments, but other payment methods will soon be added that you can easily use from the app, such as PayPal, Satispay and others.
