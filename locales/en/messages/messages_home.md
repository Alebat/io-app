**The Messages section collects all incoming communications from the organizations that offer their services through IO**.
You can set reminders for deadlines or proceed to pay a notice directly from the message.  
The messages are divided between **received** (which contains all messages received and not archived), **deadlines** (which displays only messages containing an expiration date, so as to facilitate the management of things to do), and **archived** (which keeps track of all archived messages).  
To archive a message simply hold down the area of the message to be archived, and select the "archive" button that will appear at that moment on the screen.
