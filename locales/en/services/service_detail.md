**In this section you can activate and deactivate communications relating to the specific service.** Remember that IO will only write services that have some personalized information to communicate to you, you will not receive spam or broadcast content. For this reason, all services are active by default when the app is installed.  
If you receive communications that do not interest you or if you think that it is not useful to access a particular service via IO because you prefer other channels, you can at any time deactivate the single service from this page. When a service is deactivated, you will no longer receive its communications via IO, but you will be contacted through the other available channels (eg mail, mail, SMS).  
From this page you can also manage the sending of push notifications by this service on the phone, and also the forwarding of messages to the mail, according to your preferences.
