This mail is the one you confirmed during registration.
**You can at any time change this mail according to your needs:**  
by modifying this mail, all the payments of the payments will be delivered to the new address, as well as the messages received (as defined in the preferences for forwarding messages).
We remind you that your PagoPA account is associated with the e-mail you used for the first registration, so if you change you may no longer see the archive of all your transactions in the IO app.
