**Here you can enable or disable biometric recognition.**  
The biometric recognition is disabled if not supported by this device.  
Activating biometric recognition will allow you to carry out some operations more quickly, without using the PIN, such as confirming a payment or directly accessing the application a short time after the last login with CIE or SPID.
