**In the Wallet section you will find your payment methods and the history of transactions made with PagoPA**, the payment platform for the Public Administration.

If you have completed payments with PagoPA as an authenticated user before installing the IO app, you will find here the complete history of all transactions made.

Here you can also directly pay the amounts received in a paper payment notice, if the latter shows the PagoPA logo: frame the QR code that you find in the paper notice and complete the payment directly from the app.

IO currently only supports credit / debit card payments but other payment methods such as PayPal, Satispay and others will be added soon.
